# Hey! Welcome to GuusLab 👋

Hi, I’m Guus Kaashoek, a 17-year-old web design student at Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht.  
GuusLab is my personal project where I bring my ideas to life and challenge myself to keep learning and growing. It’s a mix of everything I love: web design, tech, and experimenting.

## What is GuusLab?

GuusLab is my creative playground, but also something I take seriously. Here’s what it’s all about:
- **AI-powered chat app**: With features like streaks, personalized recaps of missed messages, and extensible AI extensions.
- **Cloud storage**: Securely store your files with premium options for extra space.
- **All-in-one app**: Notes, calendar, and more – seamlessly integrated into one platform.

GuusLab is live now! 🎉 With **GuusLab V3**, you can explore all these features and more. Check it out for free or upgrade to **GuusLab Pro** for even more options.

## Why I Do This

I love design and technology. Building something that works and looks great gives me so much energy. With GuusLab, I want to show what I’m capable of and create something people genuinely enjoy using.

## A Little About Me

I’m the only person working on GuusLab, which can be challenging, but it’s also super rewarding. I build everything using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js. I also love good design – my favorite tools are Figma and Photoshop.
